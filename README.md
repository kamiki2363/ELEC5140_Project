# ELEC5140_Project

This is the project from HKUST Module ELEC 5140 Advanced Computer Architecture. 

The aim of this project is to modify the single-issue 5-stage RISC-V processor to
improve the performance of the RISC-V processor by reducing the execution time of
programs. The implementation of the processor would be in Verilog code. The
challenge of this project is to solve the problem of hazard. Such as data hazard and
control hazard.
